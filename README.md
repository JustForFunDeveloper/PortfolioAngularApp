# Portfolio Angular App
This project is used for educational purposes only.</br>
It's based on a popular [Udemy Course for Angular 9](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).
Since it's a great course and it's using pretty much all techniques from Angular i decided to base a small Portfolio App on it.
